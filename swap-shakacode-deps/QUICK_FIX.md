# Quick Fix for Testing

The gem structure is ready but needs the actual implementation. Here's the quickest path:

## Option 1: Test Without Installing (Recommended for Now)

```bash
# Instead of installing the gem, run directly from source:
cd swap-shakacode-deps
bundle install
bundle exec ruby -Ilib bin/swap-shakacode-deps --help
bundle exec ruby -Ilib bin/swap-shakacode-deps --status
```

## Option 2: Fix the Keyword Argument Issue

The error occurs because CLI passes all options but the classes don't accept them all.
Quick fix in each manager class:

```ruby
# Change this:
def initialize(dry_run: false, verbose: false, **_options)

# To this (accepting all options):
def initialize(**options)
  @dry_run = options[:dry_run]
  @verbose = options[:verbose]
  # Ignore other options
end
```

## Option 3: Use the Original bin/swap-deps

Since the actual implementation isn't ready yet:

```bash
# Go back to the original directory
cd ..
# Use the working version
bin/swap-deps --react-on-rails ~/dev/react_on_rails
```

## My Recommendation

**Don't publish this gem yet!** It needs:

1. Actual functionality (not just stubs)
2. Tests to ensure it works
3. Real-world testing in projects

The structure is good, but users expect a published gem to work. Let's implement the core functionality first, test it thoroughly, then publish.

For now, continue using `bin/swap-deps` from this repo while we build out the gem properly.
