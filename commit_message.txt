fix: address PR review comments - module rename, security fixes, and docs updates

## Changes Made

### Package Renaming (Breaking Change)
- Renamed ReactOnRailsDemoCommon module to DemoCommon for consistency
- Renamed lib files: react_on_rails_demo_common â†’ demo_common
- Updated all references throughout the codebase
- Updated packages/demo_common/README.md with correct monorepo installation examples

### Security Fixes
- Added input validation to new-demo.sh to prevent path traversal attacks
- Added input validation to scaffold-demo.sh to prevent path traversal attacks
- Fixed variable expansion syntax error in scaffold-demo.sh (line 381)
- Fixed subshell issue in test-all.sh that prevented FAILED_DEMOS tracking

### Script Improvements
- Added JavaScript dependency installation after Rails generators in new-demo.sh
- Scripts now properly install npm/pnpm dependencies after shakapacker/react_on_rails installation
- test-all.sh now uses pushd/popd instead of subshells for proper variable propagation

### Documentation Updates
- Added Gemfile.development_dependencies for shared development dependencies across demos
- Updated VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md to reference new Ruby programs (bin/*) instead of bash scripts
- Added cypress-playwright-on-rails reference to VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md
- Documented eval_gemfile pattern for demo applications
- Added note about git branch support as a future enhancement

## Migration Guide for demo_common
