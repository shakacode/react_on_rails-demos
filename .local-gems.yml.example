# Local Gem Development Configuration
#
# Copy this file to .local-gems.yml and customize it with your local gem paths.
# The .local-gems.yml file is git-ignored for local development.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/use-local-gems --apply
#
# This will swap Gemfile and package.json dependencies to use local file paths
# or GitHub repositories instead of published gem/npm package versions.

# Option 1: Local file paths
gems:
  # Path to your local shakapacker repository
  # Gem: shakapacker (Ruby gem)
  # NPM: shakapacker (npm package at repo root)
  shakapacker: ~/dev/shakapacker

  # Path to your local react_on_rails repository
  # Gem: react_on_rails (Ruby gem)
  # NPM: react-on-rails (npm package in node_package/ subdirectory)
  react_on_rails: ~/dev/react_on_rails

  # Path to your local cypress-on-rails repository
  # Gem: cypress-on-rails (Ruby gem only, no npm package)
  # cypress-on-rails: ~/dev/cypress-on-rails

# Option 2: GitHub repositories (alternative to local paths)
# Useful for testing unreleased changes from forks or feature branches
# Repos are cloned to ~/.cache/local-gems/ and built automatically
github:
  # Simple format (uses 'main' branch by default)
  shakapacker: shakacode/shakapacker

  # With custom branch - use either format:
  # Format 1: String with #branch (npm-style)
  # react_on_rails: shakacode/react_on_rails#feature-branch

  # Format 2: Hash with repo and branch
  # react_on_rails:
  #   repo: shakacode/react_on_rails
  #   branch: feature-branch-name

  # Examples:
  # - Test a PR branch: shakacode/shakapacker#fix-hmr
  # - Test from a fork: yourname/react_on_rails#experimental
  # - Use stable branch: shakacode/shakapacker#v8-stable

  # You can mix local paths (gems:) and GitHub repos (github:)
  # GitHub repos are cloned, built, and treated like local paths

# Advanced configuration (optional)
# These are auto-detected but can be overridden if needed

# npm_paths:
#   # Subdirectory within the gem repository where the npm package lives
#   shakapacker: .              # npm package at repo root
#   react_on_rails: node_package # npm package in node_package/

# build_commands:
#   # Commands to build npm packages (auto-detected from package.json scripts)
#   react_on_rails: npm run build
#   shakapacker: npm run compile
